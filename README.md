# movie-recommendation-engine : https://recom-engin.herokuapp.com/
In this project, I have made web application demonstrating the role of NEAREST NEIGHBOUR ALGORITHM in the web and music streaming apps. I used the Content Recommendation Engine to build this web application i.e. in this the movie will be recommended on the basis of similar genres. In short, we can say that it is a content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity. I used two datasets in it which were taken from TMDB website.

There are three types of recommendation engines:

-Content based recommendation : This is a content based filtering.
-Collabrative based recommendation : In this filtering, content is filtered on the basis of the similar choices of users.
-Hybrid recommendation : It is the combination of Content based filtering and Collabrative based filtering.

The two datasets used to build this web application were:

-tmdb_5000_credits
-tmdb_5000_movies

Steps included in the process of building:
1.Project Flow
2.Dataset and Jupyter Notebook setup
3.Data Processing
4.Vectorization
5.Main function
6.Frontend/Streamlit
7.Deployment

For deployment of the application, I used Heroku.
